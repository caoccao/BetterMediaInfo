# BetterMediaInfo

BetterMediaInfo is a better GUI for [MediaInfo](https://github.com/MediaArea/MediaInfo). Why? Because I'm not a fan of the official MediaInfo GUI.

BetterMediaInfo is built on top of [MediaInfoLib](https://github.com/MediaArea/MediaInfoLib).

## Features

* MacOS (arm64) + Windows (x86_64)
